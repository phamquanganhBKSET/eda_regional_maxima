# 26th LSI Design Contest - eda_regional_maxima
This is our submission for **26th LSI Contest**. The goal is to design the hardware for Regional Maxima algorithm. </br> </br>
In this submission, we have proposed an innovative algorithm based on the original algorithm to improve some restrictions of the original one mentioned in our document. And, the hardware design is based on new proposed algorithm. </br> </br>
Here, we have both software code to describe the new algorithm and hardware code that has been designed and tested.

# How to run software simulation by python3 (new proposed algorithm)
1. Go to directory **software** at the terminal
2. Run the following commands at the terminal
```sh
$ python3 test.py
```
3. The results are located in **software/result**

# How to run hardware simulation by Questasim/Modelsim
1. Go to directory **sim/tb** at the terminal
2. Open gen_random_matrix.py, config the parameters: m - height of image, n - width of image, pixel_width, file_num - number of testcases
3. Run the following commands at the terminal
```sh
$ python3 gen_random_matrix.py
$ source ../script/qrun_bash
$ vlb;vlg;vsm
```
or simulate on GUI of Questasim/Modelsim

# How to view hardware simulation results by Questasim/Modelsim
1. After simulating as above section, standing at directory **sim/tb** and run the following command at the terminal
```sh
$ vsim -view vsim.wlf -do wave.do
```
2. File vsim.log at directory sim/tb is the result that used to be compared to model's result
